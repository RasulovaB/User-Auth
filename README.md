# User-Auth 

*The Idea of this application is to allow users to:*
- sign up as a new user
- login to see new posts
- check account information
- create new posts as an admin

*Two different levels of authentication*

Regular User | Admin User
------------ | -------------
Can see and read posts | Can create posts and make new admins

*New posts appear in the real-time*
